"""Best-effort friendly app names from the X11 window manager.

Apps that play audio through the ALSA->PulseAudio bridge report a generic
PipeWire name ("ALSA plug-in [java]"), but their owning X11 window usually
carries the real one ("RuneLite"). We bridge the two the way KDE does: match the
audio stream's ``application.process.id`` to a window's ``_NET_WM_PID``, then read
that window's name. For sandboxed apps (Flatpak) the stream PID and the window
PID are the same namespaced value, so they still match even though the host
``/proc`` knows nothing about it.

X11/XWayland only. Every failure path returns an empty map so callers fall back
to the PipeWire name; native-Wayland apps (no X11 window) just don't get enriched
and usually report a sane name already.

Caveat: two different sandboxes can each have a low namespaced PID (both "2"), so
a generic-named stream could resolve to an unrelated sandbox's window. Callers
keep this lookup to genuinely-generic names (see pipewire._is_generic) to limit
the blast radius, but it can't be fully ruled out from PID alone.
